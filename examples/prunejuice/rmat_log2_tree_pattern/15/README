This is used to test_pattern_matching.cpp in test
And used to test for edge temporal matching in input_graph_1

In this pattern, it's a tree structure, and the same as the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference:
adding temporal edge constraints:
edge 0 < edge 1
edge 1 < edge 2
edge 2 < edge 3
edge 3 < edge 4
edge 4 < edge 5
It's a basically sorted sequence of edge value

This is used to test and compare with constraints in pattern 16, and see how extra constraints effects performance
