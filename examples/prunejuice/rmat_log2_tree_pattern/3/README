This is used to test edge_pattern_matching

In this pattern, it's a tree structure, and the same as the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference is having:
- edges connecting leafs are labeled as 1
- edges connecting root are labeled as 2

This can be used to test:
First case:
- have backgroup graph label range [1].
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- see if the patterns found are none

Second case:
- have backgroup graph label range [1,2].
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- there should (but still is possible not) exists some of the pattern

Third case:
- have backgroup graph label range [1,200] and scale at 18.
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- there should not (but still is possible) exists some of the pattern


Forth case:
- generate background graph with this graph
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- check if patterns found is only one
