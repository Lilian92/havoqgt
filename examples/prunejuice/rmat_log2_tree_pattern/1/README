This is used to test edge_pattern_matching

In this pattern, it's a tree structure, and the same as the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference is having all the edges have label as 1.

This can be used to test:
First case:
- have all the edge label same (1) in both the backgroup graph and the pattern.
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- compare if the patterns found is the same with the one with no edge pattern matching

Second case:
- generate background graph with this graph
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- check if patterns found is only one
