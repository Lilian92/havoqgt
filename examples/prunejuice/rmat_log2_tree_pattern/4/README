This is used to test edge_pattern_matching

In this pattern, it's a tree structure, and the same as the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference:
- vertices are having unique label, in the range of [1, 7], thus, this example don't have non-local constraint
- having all the edges have label as 2 or 3.

This can be used to test local constraint checking:
First case:
- have all the edge label as (1) in the backgroup graph.
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- compare if the patterns found is 0

Second case:
- generate background graph with labels [1, 5]
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- there should exist subgraph

Third case:
- generate background graph with this graph
- run the program with edge pattern matching
- see if the program runs successfully
- check if patterns found is only one
