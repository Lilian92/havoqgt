This is used to test_pattern_matching.cpp in test
And used to test for edge temporal matching in input_graph_1

In this pattern, it's a tree structure, and the same as the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference:
adding temporal edge constraints:
edge 0 < edge 1
edge 2 < edge 3
edge 5 < edge 4
As we can see, it's all local temporal constraints

This can be used to test:
With background graph input_graph_1.hpp
There should be 4 matches
