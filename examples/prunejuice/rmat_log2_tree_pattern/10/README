This is used to test temporal_matching

In this pattern, it's a tree structure, and the same as the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference is:
It adds a vertex (7) with label 1 and connected to the vertex (1) with label 4.
It has pattern_temporal_constraint:
edge(0) < edge(1)
edge(1) < edge(6)
edge(0) < edge(6)
edge(0) < edge(3)
edge(1) < edge(3)

In this, edge(0) < edge(6) is redandent checking, and should be avoided in preprocessing.
