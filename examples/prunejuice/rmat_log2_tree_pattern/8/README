This is used to test_pattern_matching.cpp in test
And used to test for edge matching

In this pattern, it's similiar with the one in SC18 prunejuice paper.
The difference is:
adding various edge data.
combined the two vertices that both have label 7 to form a cycle.

This can be used to test:
With background graph input_graph_1.hpp
There should be 1 match
